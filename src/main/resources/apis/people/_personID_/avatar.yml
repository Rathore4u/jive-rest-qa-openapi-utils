  operationId: getAvatar
  description: Return the binary content of the avatar image for the specified user.
    If width is defined and height is not defined (or vice versa) then the returned
    size will depend on the value defined for aspect ratio. For instance, if the original
    image is 100 (W)x 600 (H) and 50 (W) is requested with preserveAspectRatio equals
    true, then the returned image will be 50 (W) x 300 (H). If preserveAspectRatio
    was false then the returned image will be 50 (W) x 600 (H). Remember that width
    and height are maximum possible values. This means that if you request 150 (W)
    then you will get 100 (W) since that is the size of the image.
