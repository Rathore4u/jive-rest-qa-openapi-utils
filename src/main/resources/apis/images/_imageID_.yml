  description: Return the specified image as binary content. If width is defined and
    height is not defined (or vice versa) then the returned size will depend on the
    value defined for aspect ratio. For instance, if the original image is 100 (W)x
    600 (H) and 50 (W) is requested with preserveAspectRatio equals true, then the
    returned image will be 50 (W) x 300 (H). If preserveAspectRatio was false then
    the returned image will be 50 (W) x 600 (H). Remember that width and height are
    maximum possible values. This means that if you request 150 (W) then you will
    get 100 (W) since that is the size of the image.
